# Crpyto-Miner-Crypto-Stak-0-donation-level
AMD\CPU miner no Donation wasnt compiled with Nvidia drivers installed - if you wish you can download the main files and run as this includes the old Nvidia .dll and with some tinkering you can get this to work - i personally can not be bothered as i am not running Nvidia miners.
This has been pulled from thew NEW XMR-Stak 2.5


I love learning and this was my first time compiling code - I still feel donations should be made to the creators.

2% i feel is alot due to how many people use teh actual software (No dont take this away from them - but HIGH elec, HIGH pc prices in some countries 2% is alot of profit for some)

Feel free to drop me a donation if you so to wish: I am slowly working my way to understanding and possibly creating my own standalone miner :)
